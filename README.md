**Problem**: Marketing Ops teams are reactive firefighters - issues get reported AFTER campaigns fail.

**Solution**: Automated anomaly detection that catches email deliverability drops, form breaks, lead flow issues, and integration failures within hours, not days.

**Result**: 54 issues detected in 30-day simulation, including 4 critical alerts that would have broken campaigns.
